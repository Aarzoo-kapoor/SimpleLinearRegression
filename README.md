# SimpleLinearRegression
After gaining basic knowledge about python libraries, the next step was to learn how to preprocess a dataset. After acquiring the skill, the next approach was how to deploy machine learning models on a given dataset. My first machine learning model was simple linear regression it demonstrates how to predict a target variable based on one independent variable and for that weâ€™ll use the popular dataset of House Prices Prediction Dataset

Overview

This dataset aims to predict House Prices based on the Square Footage of the property. It serves as a simple example for implementing linear regression techniques to model relationships between house size and price. By analyzing this dataset, you can build models to forecast house prices based on the given square footage.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

Square Footage: The area of the house in square feet.

Price: The price of the house in USD.

Data Format

The dataset is stored in a CSV file.

Applications

Simple Linear Regression: Predict house prices based on square footage.

Data Visualization: Plotting price against square footage to visualize trends.
